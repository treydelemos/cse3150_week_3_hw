README.md: short explanation of how you used pointers, const, references, casting, exceptions, and control flow

I used pointers as an array of pointers for strings in names[], and in gpaPtr to modify gpa values. I used const to prevent the changes of the student names and gpa values. I used references for int& size to track the number of students. I used exceptions for empty lists and capacity limits. I used for loops for array traversal and if statemtns for validation. I used tatic cast when printing the average GPA to show the rounded integer value.
